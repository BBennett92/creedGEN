This python script 'creedGEN' will generate a wordlist called
'creedPWNlist.txt'
for the VulnHub box 'The Office: Doomsday Device' needed
to brute force one of the flags and this tool will
come in handy for you! Prints 'creed' with a combination
of 3 numbers as the clue states such as 'creed123, creed456, etc.'
enjoy this if you find it!
